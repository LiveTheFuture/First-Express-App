First Express App

This is an app built with Express that connects to MongoDB and performs CRUD operations on data.

It makes use of MongoDB Atlas as a cloud storage.

When the app is created and listening on a port, a connection is made to MongoDB Atlas via a connection string.

Then routes were created for posting data, getting data, updating data and deleting data.
